Multifunctional tool for security tasks

Here are 5 options:

Option 1: You can find out what SIM card someone has based on their number, and from which country and city it is.

Option 2: It generates words for you. It’s not very interesting and is mainly for use in your code.

Option 3: It scans the ports you want and checks various ports.

Option 4: It sends a large number of requests to a server with an http or https address.

Option 5: It creates a password for you with your desired characters, and it’s better to use it for your account security.

Thanks, this was YHI547. I hope this tool is useful for you.
